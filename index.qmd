# Course overview

Creating clear and effective **data visualizations** is an important skill for any data scientist. This course will teach participants the key principles of data visualization and how to use the `ggplot2`library, along with useful extensions, to create high-quality plots efficiently. After completing the course, participants will have a strong understanding of how to make engaging and accessible visualizations. We will discuss the main concepts of the grammar of graphics and use hands-on examples to explore `ggplot2`'s utility to create multi-layered, more complex graphs.

## Learning objectives

-   Able to do data formatting.
-   Understanding the general concepts of ggplot2.
-   Learning the many options of customizing a ggplot.
-   Learning to plot multiple data visualization.
-   Gaining the major steps need to create engaging graphics.
-   Hands on workshop with a project component.

## Is this course for me?

This course will be appropriate for you if you answer yes to these questions:

-   Do you aim to build graphics in a fully reproducible way without the need to manually adjust details afterwards?

-   Are you a biologist wanting to get make high quality graphics and learn bit of programming?

# Prework

Some basic knowledge of `R` programming is needed. One can learn from Alex Douglas et al. book [A introduction to R](https://intro2r.com/). If you want to run the workshop content locally on your machine, please make sure to install a suitable IDE (Rstudio, VS Code or others), a recent version of R.

## Required Packages to be installed

-   *tidyverse*

Run this code to install the packages if needed:

```         
packages <- c('tidyverse')

install.packages(setdiff(packages, rownames(installed.packages())))  
```
